# Solo TTRPGs

I've been exploring solo tabletop role-playing games for reasons explained in my blog post ["Solo RPGs as a creative practice"](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2023/solo-rpgs-creative-practice).

This list is based on my own interests, so it includes some obscure stuff and omits many popular games such as [Ironsworn](https://github.com/Billiam/awesome-ironsworn).

## Games

### Minimal/freeform

These are aids to "playing a story" in my head. I'm parked here for now because life with a baby and a toddler isn't conducive to sitting down to play a game.

- Pseudorandom numbers in my head:
  - [d6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/comments/qweave/rhinos_a_diceless_selfcontained_pseudorandom/): presence of one of the letters RHINOS
  - [d10](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/18miau9/comment/ke4i7im/): sum of letter positions of a random word
  - Or an online dice roller: [Keeper's Dice Roller](https://keeper.farirpgs.com/dice)
- Simple oracles that I can pull up on my phone, when I need inspiration:
  - [Zero Dice](https://tangent-zero.com/zero_dice/zero_dice.htm)
