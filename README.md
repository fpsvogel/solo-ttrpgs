# Solo TTRPGs

I've been exploring solo tabletop role-playing games for reasons explained in my blog post ["Solo RPGs as a creative practice"](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2023/solo-rpgs-creative-practice). But also to have fun!

This list is based on my own interests, rather than aiming to be exhaustive or based on popularity (e.g. [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com) is absent).

### Freeform story-making

These are nothing more than aids to coming up with a story. I'm parked here for now because life with a baby (soon two) isn't conducive to sitting down to play a game. But I don't see this as a bad thing necessarily: I'm still practicing the essence of story-making, which is my goal in this whole endeavor.

- The tiniest, most portable oracle: [sum of letter positions of a random word](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/18miau9/comment/ke4i7im/)
- Simple oracles that I can pull up on my phone, when I need something more:

  - [Zero Dice](https://tangent-zero.com/zero_dice/zero_dice.htm)
  - [TaleWeaver cards](https://www.scribd.com/document/98415/TaleWeaver-Card-Deck) if I go to a random page in the PDF

### Space-themed

- Cepheus Engine:
  - [Retro Sci-Fi Rules](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/456143/retro-sci-fi-rules) is just an updated Traveller. It's a simple and minimalist starting point.
  - [Travelling Alone](https://www.freelancetraveller.com/features/rules/alone.html)

  - [An explanation of the various versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1efz4fg/comment/lfopl95/)

### Medieval-themed

These are a lot more *crunchy* (as the more numbers-heavy games are described) than I would normally go for, but I just can't resist their medieval literary-historical settings.

- [Pendragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendragon_(role-playing_game))

- [Maelstrom](https://drivethrurpg.com/publisher/667/arion-games/category/4422/maelstrom), especially Domesday and Rome

### World-building

These could be useful for building out the setting of a game or story.

## Tools

Some of the games listed above are actually designed for group play. But with the right tools, most TTRPGs can be played solo.
